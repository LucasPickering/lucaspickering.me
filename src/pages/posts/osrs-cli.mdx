## What is it?

OSRS CLI is a command line tool for Old School RuneScape that makes it easy to look up prices, hiscores, and more from the terminal. No more opening the browser for simple operations! There's a lot of functionality involved here. See the site (linked above) for full documentation as well as a live demo.
