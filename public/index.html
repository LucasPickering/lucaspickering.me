          Hi! My name is Lucas Pickering, and welcome to my website! If this
          <i>phenomenal</i> site doesn't blow you away, check out some of my
          other projects, some of which are actually mildly impressive (or
          don't, you don't have to listen to me, I'm just an HTML file).

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I like doing just about anything with computers: web development
            (frontend & backend), networks, compilers, game development, systems
            programming, robotics, and building keyboards. I graduated from
            Northeastern University in 2019 and now live in the Boston area.
          </p>

            <h3>Languages</h3>
            <p>
              Most of my experience is in <b>JavaScript/TypeScript</b> and
              <b>Python</b>, but my favorite language, by far, is <b>Rust</b>.
              Rust is awesome. I'm very much still learning it, but its
              semantics, design patterns, safety guarantees, and ecosystem make
              it a fantastic language. I also like functional languages (I have
              experience with <b>Racket</b> and <b>OCaml</b>) because they're
              very easy to reason about, and also generally quite neat-o.

              Keskne (Estonian for "central") is a set of service and
              configurations I wrote to make it easy to deploy all of my
              different websites from one machine. It provides reverse proxying
              to serve multiple domains off one server, and database
              management/backup. It powers all of my publicly hosted websites,
              including this one!
